## Week 1 - History
- add bullet points here for atleast 2 notes to remember for mid term.
- look up https://github.com/kamrik/IntroText/tree/main/summaries

## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
The **Bit**
- Can hold with one of two possible values: On/Off, True/False, Hi/Low, 0/1
the **Byte**
- Consists of 8 bits. 0000-0000
- We call 8 bytes Word. Bit>byte(8 bits)>WORD (8 bytes or 64 bits)
- Number of States for a given # of Bits is 2^N This means that it looks to the number of the bit after the last one. Exammple:
    4 bits has 2^4 states. which is 16 states. This is the same value as a 5th bit which is 2^4. Remeber bit one uses 2^0, so using the N as the power ignores 0 index and returns the full range of states.
  - Remeber a Kilo can be either 1000, or 1024 and depending on the application this destinction is important.
  **Signed Bytes**
    - 8 bit signed doesnt reach 255 it reaches -128 to 127. Bit 8, makes it -128 And now you can leave the rest as 0, or you can subtract the remainters to get to -1.
        You can also leave everything off as 0, or you can turn on everything but bit 8, giving you 1 less then a full 128. 64+32+16+8+4+2+1=127
    - floating point: 32 bit numbers use bit 32 as the sign, the next 8 bits are for the intagral and the final 23 are the floating point fractional.
      this means the max number is probably +127.
**Other Information**
ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange

## Week 3 - Markup Languages
- Markup languages provide instructions on how to display and interpret text.
- MarkDown IS a markup language, its just very simple. unline HTML, it is optimized for readability in plain text format. This means keeping the formatting simple. As above seing bold as ** or __ is much more visually apitizing.
- YAML â€“ Yet Another ML or YAML Ain't Markup Language
- HTML is rendered by the browser, because this code is very complex, web browsers adhere to many standards maintained and developed by the W3C and some other organizations

  **Structured Data**
- JSON and XML are structured data in a text format. (Good for storing data mor elike a spreadsheet)
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
- JSON is newer and used more, its replacing XML. XML is still in use though.
- JSON and XML are serialized data. This just means that Data from a program was converted into a more readable format. So an array's data can be extracted and put in a easy to read format in a JSON. This is now considered serialized.

data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30
}
into
{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
