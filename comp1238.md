## Week 1 - History

  **Early Printing**
- Early printing used Cylinder Seals: Used in Mesopotamia for stamping.
- Woodblock Printing: Old wood-block print dated 868 AD in the text itself (Diamond Sutra).
- 
 **Typeface**
- Typeface is the design of letters
- Font is a collection of typefaces

## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes

  **Bit**
- Can hold with one of two possible values: On/Off, True/False, Hi/Low, 0/1
- 
  **Byte**
- Consists of 8 bits. 0000-0000
- We call 8 bytes Word. Bit>byte(8 bits)>WORD (8 bytes or 64 bits)
- Number of States for a given # of Bits is 2^N This means that it looks to the number of the bit after the last one. Exammple:
    4 bits has 2^4 states. which is 16 states. This is the same value as a 5th bit which is 2^4. Remeber bit one uses 2^0, so using the N as the power ignores 0 index and returns the full range of states.
  - Remeber a Kilo can be either 1000, or 1024 and depending on the application this destinction is important.
  - 
  **Signed Bytes**
    - 8 bit signed doesnt reach 255 it reaches -128 to 127. Bit 8, makes it -128 And now you can leave the rest as 0, or you can subtract the remainters to get to -1.
        You can also leave everything off as 0, or you can turn on everything but bit 8, giving you 1 less then a full 128. 64+32+16+8+4+2+1=127
    - floating point: 32 bit numbers use bit 32 as the sign, the next 8 bits are for the intagral and the final 23 are the floating point fractional.
      this means the max number is probably +127.
      
  **Other Information**
ASCII = American Standard Code for Information Interchange

## Week 3 - Markup Languages
- Markup languages provide instructions on how to display and interpret text.
- MarkDown IS a markup language, its just very simple. unline HTML, it is optimized for readability in plain text format. This means keeping the formatting simple. As above seing bold as ** or __ is much more visually apitizing.
- YAML – Yet Another ML or YAML Ain't Markup Language
- HTML is rendered by the browser, because this code is very complex, web browsers adhere to many standards maintained and developed by the W3C and some other organizations

  **Structured Data**
- JSON and XML are structured data in a text format. (Good for storing data mor elike a spreadsheet)
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
- JSON is newer and used more, its replacing XML. XML is still in use though.
- JSON and XML are serialized data. This just means that Data from a program was converted into a more readable format. So an array's data can be extracted and put in a easy to read format in a JSON. This is now considered serialized.

data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30
}
into
{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

  **Escaping**
- HTML Character Reference escape  < or quotes by using &lt; &quot; there are many character refrences so you can display a lot.

  **ASCII Code / Unicode**
- This code assigns a number to characters. This is called codepoints and it writen in hex. U+8625 ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒ <- Medium Shade character  
- unicode extends ASCII, their first 128 chars are the same
- 7-bit ASCII uses a table of 3 bit by 1 byte. (0-f rows, 0-8 columns) in binary. May have a leading 1 bit not used so it's 0
- UTF 32 uses 4 bytes, so there is a lot of wasted bits.
- 
## Week 4 - Markup Languages
- Some keyboard modifiers are Win key, Cmd key nad the Fn key. Two of which are found on my keyboard.
- Keyboards use different kinds of switching technology, linear, tactile and clicky. In my opinion Clicky is the best and with concaved keys, so sadly I would take the bluepill.
- Keypresses send keyevents to the compter. The time is looged, the key is stated with a code and the value of being pushed or releaseed is sent.
- Touchtyping is to be able to type without lookingm using repition and memory. I call the oppsoite of this, 'Chicken Picken'.
- Word Processors are different form Text Editors. Word processors add a lot of functionality that you wouldnt see from the latter.
- And IDE is an editor with lots of added features like varifying code, predictive typing, emmit and such.
- Most popular editor/IDE is vistual Studio Code. Or VSCode.
   
  **Regex**
- RegEx is regular expressions on searching text by using search patterns.
- using '.' makes a wildcard, matching any character at this location so using '.' as the regex would select everything!
- [1-6] selects any number within that range
- [oia] this wold select if any of the three are present. b[aui]g this would select if available big bag bug, but it wouldnt select bog.
- \d+ means to match a digit one or more times
- [a-z]+\.com would return .com websites that do not have numbers in them, only letters (this is not case specific).
- 192\.168\.1\.\d{1,3} in this case it is escaping '.' so it will look for "192.168.1.1" or "192.168.1.33452". The d{1,3} means that there must atleast 1 digit and will select up to the third digit. If it was {4,4} It would only return numbers such as "192.168.1.0001"

## Week 5 - CLI
- Cli stands for command line interface.
- Some functionalities are only available via CLI.
- Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces.

  **Commands**
- ls: List the files a directory
- cd: Change directory
- pwd: Print working director
- cat: Display file contents
- less: Fiew file contents interactivley
- cp: Copy files
- mv: Move files
- mkdir: Create a directrory
- ping: Test network connectivity

  **Remote Access**
  - *SSH (Secure Shell) Connects to a remote computer securley and allows command access.
  - File Transfers can be used using scp (securely copy files) and sftp (secure file transfer protocol)
